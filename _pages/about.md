William is a research scientist with Leidos, part of the Leidos Research Support Team supporting the DOE's National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL ["N-E-T-L" not "nettle"]). His research interests range from fundamental research of multiphase flow instabilities using high-resolution CFD to the application of system codes for nuclear reactor thermal-hydraulics and safety analysis. His current focus is V&V of the developmental MFIX-Exa code and simulation-based optimization with Nodeworks. 

William earned his B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. from Purdue University, School of Nuclear Engineering in 2008, 2009 and 2014 under the supervision of Prof. Martín López de Bertodano. Before supporting NETL, William post-doc’ed under the supervision of Prof. Christine Hrenya at the University of Colorado Boulder, Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering.
